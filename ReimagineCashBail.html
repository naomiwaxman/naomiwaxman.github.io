More than 60 percent of jailed people in the United States have not yet been tried for the crime they are accused of, according a 2015 report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. A report from the Vera Institute of Justice found that confining these people costs nearly $14 billion each year. As researchers and legal experts struggle with this issue across the country, Cook County courts are taking action to address the problem.<br><br>

Chief Judge Timothy C. Evans of Cook County issued an order July 17 that as of September 1, judges are to ensure that bail for felony defendants who are not a threat to the public must be set an amount they can afford at the time of the hearing. The order states that Evans will institute the same policy for misdemeanor offenses as of January 1, 2018.<br><br>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Evans changes cash-bail process for more pretrial release<a href="https://t.co/sw6r84Ue87">https://t.co/sw6r84Ue87</a></p>&mdash; Cook County Court IL (@CookCntyCourt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CookCntyCourt/status/886982099563143174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

“Defendants should not be sitting in jail awaiting trial simply because they lack the financial resources to secure their release,” Evans wrote in a statement to the press. “If they are not deemed a danger to any person or the public, my order states that they will receive a bail they can afford.”<br><br>

    Of the approximately 8,000 people held in Cook County jails each day in 2016, only five percent had been convicted of a crime, according to a January 2017 report by Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart.

Loss of housing, employment and other social and financial problems often emerge from these long-term stays, according to research by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. The same report also found that people in jail have diminished access to legal counsel and contribute to their own defense.<br><br>

“This order represents a dramatic improvement of our pretrial justice system in Cook County and thus our entire criminal justice system,” Sharlyn Grace, senior criminal justice policy analyst at Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice, wrote in a statement.<br><br>

Community leaders have also expressed support for Evans’ order. A 2014 report from the Vera Institute found that African-Americans are more likely to await trial in jail than whites or other racial minorities. The report said this racial disparity may correlate with an inability to pay cash bail.<br><br>

“These small-time charges can just devastate people,” said the Rev. Otis Moss III, pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. “They can lose their income. They can lose their kids. I applaud Judge Evans for addressing this crisis.”
